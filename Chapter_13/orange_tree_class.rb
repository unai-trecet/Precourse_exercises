# Orange tree. Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns
# its height and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the tree one
# year. Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think an orange
# tree should grow in a year), and after some number of years (again, your
# call) the tree should die. For the first few years, it should not produce
# fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older trees produce
# more each year than younger trees...whatever you think makes the most
# sense. And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns
# the number of oranges on the tree) and pick_an_orange (which reduces the
# @orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange
# was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this
# year). Make sure any oranges you donâ€™t pick one year fall off before the
# next year.
